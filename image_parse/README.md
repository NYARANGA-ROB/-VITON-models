## Overview:
This part of the pipeline is dedicated to segmenting human body parts from images using various datasets such as LIP, ATR, and PASCAL. The system uses a pretrained model that automatically downloads ONNX and Prototxt files during the first run.
## Requirements:
```bash
pip install ailia
```

## Reference
This implementation is based on the paper <a href="https://github.com/GoGoDuck912/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing" target="_blank">Self Correction for Human Parsing</a>
